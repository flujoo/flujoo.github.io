## Projects

### R Package *gm* for Music Generation

[Github](https://github.com/flujoo/gm) | [Complete Guide](https://flujoo.github.io/gm/articles/gm.html)

R package *gm* provides an elegant language with which you can create music scores and audio files with ease. It works smoothly with R Markdown and can embed music in HTML and PDF files. It is useful for music education and algorithmic music composition.


### Python Package *ch0p1n* for Automatic Composition

[Github](https://github.com/flujoo/ch0p1n) | [Introduction](/en/my-approach-to-automatic-musical-composition/)

Python package *ch0p1n* provides a framework for manipulation of music motifs to generate music. The basic idea is that music can be generated from a small amount of core materials under some common operations such as repetition and elaboration.

This package is only a prototype for now.


### Music Album *Night*

[Audio and Scores](/en/my-music-album-night/)

The music album *Night* is written for solo piano. It describes images and subtle feelings related to night.

Also check [my other music](/en/my-early-music/).


### Book *Data Science of Pink Floyd*

[PDF](/assets/data-science-of-pink-floyd.pdf)

The idea behind the book *Data Science of Pink Floyd* is to collect and analyze data about the band Pink Floyd with R data science tools.

The book is still in progress.
