## Intuitions

Psychological characters, attributes or constructs, e.g. human intelligence, creativity, are among the objects of psychological studies. Unlike physical characters such as the height and weight of a human body, psychological constructs like creativity can not be measured directly.

But intuitively, we tend to consider some people, e.g. Albert Einstein, more creative than others, which implies that creativity can be measured to some extent, that we may find an appropriate function from a set of people to a set of numbers representing people's degree of creativity.

How to find such a function? As mentioned, we have intuitions about psychological constructs. Operationally speaking, an intuition is a propostition. As for creativity, we may possess propositions like "Western people are more creative than Eastern people", and "creative people are good at solving problems". Some of these intuitions are operational and they can provide a  foundation for measuring psychological constructs.


## Criteria

Suppose a psychologist has an intuitive understanding of creativity like "creative people's brains are heavier". Under this intuition, this psychologist may use brain weight as an index of people's degree of creativity. Operationalized intuitions play a role in psychological studies as what axioms serve in a mathematical theory. A psychologist has to operationalize or make explicit his or her intuitions about creativity before he starts studies like figuring out the relationship between creativity and intelligence.

In the context of psychometrics, operationalized intuitions are called __criteria__. Variables, as the above-mentioned brain weight, involved in these intuitions are called critierion variables.


## Tests

In practical applications, we may need frequently to measure characters of subjects, but sometimes it is not easy, if not impossible, to measure criterion variables. Consider an intuition, "creative people are more likely to achieve a Nobel Prize". Under this intuition, how do we quantify a person's degree of creativity? Do we have to wait for decades to see if a person will achieve a Nobel Prize? This seems to be very impractical.

Tests come onto the stage since it is hard to measure crition variables in some situations.

A psychological test such as an IQ test is built on some intuitions about a psychological construct and is proved to reflect the construct or a set of criterion variables. As a criterion variable is an index of a psychological construct, a test is an easier-to-use proxy of the criterion variable. A good test can save a psychologist's time, quantify people's degree of creativity, and predict people's probability of achieving a Nobel Prize.


## Normative and Empirical Questions

Empirical psychological studies are not based on a single psychologist's intuitions. About a psychological construct, other psychologists may possess totally different intuitive understanding from yours, they may not think that your operational definitions well capture the essence of the construct. At the level of a scientific community, psychologists with different intuitions may reach a consensus which we may call "intuitions of the scientific community". No matter how flourishing the empirical studies are in a community, they are inevitably the consequences of intuitions of the community.

According to a set of criteria, psychologists can develop many tests, which one to choose and which one to abandon? These are __empirical questions__. We make decisions based on tests' psychometric properties. If a test has high reliability and validity, no doubt it is the very test to choose.

But what if psychologists have different intuitions and different criteria at that? Which criterion to use to develop a test? These are __normative questions__, which can not be settled based solely on emprirical data.

How do we handle normative questions? Maybe like how people develop a standard of the sizes of screws and nuts in industry, psychologists would have conferences to negotiate for a standard of what a legitimate criterion should be. Or maybe a fruitful pioneer psychologist would establish her/his authority in developing a standard.

But there is a possibility that all the psychologists' intuitions can not capture the essence of a psychological construct, neither can they find a satisfying set of criteria. Then "meta-questions" would come out, is there no such thing we call creativity in a strict sense? The string "creativity" would then be used only in a loose sense to refer to some psychological characters or phenomena, psychologists would then start focusing on these characters or phenomena rather than a high-order construct called creativity.
