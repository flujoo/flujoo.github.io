In this blog, I will introduce my approach to automatic musical composition, including the theory, the algorithm, and a Python package implementation ["ch0p1n"](https://github.com/flujoo/ch0p1n).


## What Is Automatic Composition?

Automatic composition is using algorithms to generate music.

As a trivial example, imagine that you put a cat on a piano to randomly press keys to generate music. The music is thus the result of a predetermined algorithm rather than of your instantaneous emotions or compositional skills. This is why it is called *automatic* composition.

Automatic composition has many different approaches or paradigms. You may want to read the book [Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Composition-Paradigms-Automated-Generation/dp/3211999159/) for a big picture.

The approach I take is inspired by the theories of Arnold Schoenberg, Heinrich Schenker and William Caplin. The key idea is that **music can develop or be generated from limited materials under some common operations**. I will explain this idea in the following two sections.


## Generate Music from Limited Materials

Let's see an example, the beginning of Beethoven's first piano sonata:

<audio controls>
  <source src="assets/beethoven_sonata.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

As indicated below, the two framed structures are almost identical:

In fact, the structure in the blue frame can be generated by merely transposing the structure in the red one. In composing this piece, Beethoven reused or slightly modified a previously created structure rather than conceive a new one.

The same situation happens in other parts too. As indicated below, the four framed structures are also highly similar:

Does this kind of reuse exist only in Beethoven's music? No, this probably happens in every musical work. No matter how long a musical work lasts or how varied it can sound, the amount of its core materials is always small.

For another example, the following is an excerpt from Mozart's K. 485:

Sometimes, however, a core material can be modified so much that you can barely recognize it, as in the following example, the beginning of Chopinâ€™s nocturne Op.9 No.1:
