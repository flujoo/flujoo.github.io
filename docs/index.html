<main><h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>I write code, compose music, and write code that composes music.</p>
<p>As a software developer, I am interested in music generation. My works have received much positive feedback from researchers and developers. As a music composer, my pursuit is to create music that precisely captures subtle or complex emotions.</p>
<h2 id="my-blog">My Blog</h2>
<p><a href="/en">English</a> | <a href="/cn">Chinese</a> | <a href="/index.xml">RSS</a></p>
<p>My English blog is about music theory, composition, and programming.</p>
<p>My Chinese blog is mainly about education, psychology, and self-learning skills.</p>
