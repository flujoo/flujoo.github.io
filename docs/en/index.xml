      <description>Here are some of my early compositions. Most of them are for practice purposes excerpt for the first one &amp;ldquo;Wind Is Ring&amp;rdquo;. The audio files are generated by MuseScore or Finale, so they may sound a little mechanical, although I tried to make them sound as natural as possible by carefully setting dynamics, pedals and tempos. Hope you can ignore the sound effect and enjoy the music.

      <description>Given a harmonic progression and the first accompaniment motif, how to automatically generate an entire accompaniment progression?
In this blog, I will tackle this problem with R language and R package &amp;ldquo;gm&amp;rdquo;. Please note that, for illustrative purposes, the solution presented here is only a simplified version. I will talk more about this in the last section.
Let&amp;rsquo;s first clarify the problem, before diving into it.
Clarify the Problem Take the beginning of Chopin&amp;rsquo;s nocturne Op.</description>

      <description>Music analysis is not a single method, framework, or theory; it has many different kinds. However, most kinds of music analysis can be put into the three categories I put forward in this blog.
Below I will talk about these three types of music analysis. And for illustrative purposes, I will use them to analyse Chopin&amp;rsquo;s nocturne Op.72 No.1. If you have not heard this nocturne yet, I highly recommend Maurizio Pollini&amp;rsquo;s performance.</description>

      <description>I have been working on my first music album &amp;ldquo;Night&amp;rdquo; recently. This is a dark ambient album, which describes images and emotions related to night. The whole album is written for solo piano, so if you would like to play any piece of it, send me an email to get the score.
This album is not fully completed yet. I am posting here only the first four pieces:
Prelude &amp;ldquo;Midnight&amp;rdquo;  Prelude &amp;ldquo;Moonlight&amp;rdquo;  Prelude &amp;amp; Fugue &amp;ldquo;Street after Rain&amp;rdquo;  Sonata &amp;ldquo;A Rainy Night&amp;rdquo;  </description>
