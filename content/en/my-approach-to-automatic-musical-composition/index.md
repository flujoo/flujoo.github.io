In this blog, I will introduce my approach to automatic musical composition, including the theory, the algorithm, and a Python package implementation ["ch0p1n"](https://github.com/flujoo/ch0p1n).


## What Is Automatic Composition?

Automatic composition is using algorithms to generate music.

As a trivial example, imagine that you put a cat on a piano to randomly press keys to generate music. The music generated is thus the result of a predetermined algorithm rather than of your instantaneous emotions or compositional skills. This is why it is called *automatic* composition.

Automatic composition has many different approaches or paradigms. You may want to read the book [Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Composition-Paradigms-Automated-Generation/dp/3211999159/) for a big picture.

The approach I take is inspired by theories about **how music could develop from limited materials under some common operations**, especially the theories of Arnold Schoenberg and Heinrich Schenker. I will talk more about this later.


## How Is Automatic Composition Possible?

Music may seem to come from intuition, inspiration or emotions, then how is automatic composition possible? The answer is that **music always has so great an extent of redundancy and regularity** that we can formalize the process of music generation.

Let's see an example, the beginning of Beethoven's first piano sonata:

<audio controls>
  <source src="assets/beethoven_sonata.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

As indicated below, the two structures in the frames look almost the same:

In fact, the blue structure can be generated by merely transposing the red structure. In composing this piece, Beethoven re-used or slightly modified a previously created structure rather than conceive a new one.

The same situation happens in other parts too. Do the structures in the red frames as indicated below look similar to you?

This is what I mean by **redundancy**: the amount of a musical work's core materials is always small, no matter how long the music lasts or how varied it can sound.
