## About

I write code, compose music, and write code that composes music.

As a software developer, I am interested in music generation. My works have received much positive feedback from researchers and developers. As a music composer, my pursuit is to create music that precisely captures subtle or complex emotions.


## My Blog

[English](/en) | [Chinese](/cn) | [RSS](/index.xml)

My English blog is about music theory, composition, and programming.

My Chinese blog is mainly about education, psychology, and self-learning skills.


## Projects

### R Package *gm* for Music Score and Audio Generation

[Github](https://github.com/flujoo/gm) | [Complete Guide](https://flujoo.github.io/gm/articles/gm.html)

Easily generate music scores and audio files in HTML and PDF files. Useful for music education, musicological research, and algorithmic music composition.


### Python Package *ch0p1n* for Automatic Composition

[Github](https://github.com/flujoo/ch0p1n) | [Introduction](/en/my-approach-to-automatic-musical-composition/)

Manipulate music motifs to generate music. The key idea is that even structurally complex music can be generated from a small amount of core materials under some common operations such as repetition and elaboration. This package is only a prototype for now.


### Classical Music Album *Night*

[Audio and Scores](/en/my-music-album-night/)

Images and subtle feelings related to night. Written for solo piano. Also check [my other music](/en/my-early-music/).


### Book *Data Science of Pink Floyd*

[PDF](/assets/data-science-of-pink-floyd.pdf)

Collect and analyze any data about Pink Floyd. R data science tools are used. Still in progress.
