<main><p>Here is my first music album <em>Night</em>. It is a dark ambient album written for solo piano, which describes images and emotions related to night. This album has not been completed yet, so I present here only the first four works. The audio files are generated by Logic Pro.</p>
<h2 id="prelude-midnight">Prelude <em>Midnight</em></h2>

<p>It is midnight. The grandfather clock in the living room is ringing. You are transitioning from wakefulness to sleep.</p>
<h2 id="prelude-moonlight">Prelude <em>Moonlight</em></h2>
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/moonlight.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

<p><a href="scores/moonlight.pdf">Score</a></p>
<p>The moon over the sea is blurred in the clouds. As the waves get stronger and stronger, the moon looms out.</p>
<h2 id="prelude--fugue-street-after-rain">Prelude &amp; Fugue <em>Street after Rain</em></h2>
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/street.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<p><a href="scores/street.pdf">Score</a></p>
<p>It is two o&rsquo;clock a.m. You have just got out of a bar and are now walking on a street. It just rained, so the pavement is wet, reflecting the lights. You are a little drunk. You feel chill, comfortable, and wistful.</p>
<h2 id="sonata-a-rainy-night">Sonata <em>A Rainy Night</em></h2>
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio/rainy.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>
<p><a href="scores/rainy.pdf">Score</a></p>
<p>It is late in the night. A cold wind is blowing outside. You feel it is about to rain. An unsettled feeling reminds you of a similar night many years ago. Faces in your memories are so unclear. What is left is only a feeling of suspense. You remember you felt cold, confused and frustrated. Where are they now? You ask youself. A heavy rain suddenly comes down and soon stops. Then there is only an ominous silence.</p>
