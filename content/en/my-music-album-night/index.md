I have been working on my first music album "Night" recently. This is a dark ambient album, which describes images and emotions related to night. The whole album is written for solo piano, so if you would like to play any piece of it, send me an E-mail to get the score.

This album is not fully completed yet. I am posting here only the first four pieces:


## Prelude "Midnight"
