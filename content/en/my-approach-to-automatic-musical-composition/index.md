In this blog, I will introduce my approach to automatic musical composition, including the theory, the algorithm, and a Python package implementation ["ch0p1n"](https://github.com/flujoo/ch0p1n).


## What Is Automatic Composition?

Automatic composition is using algorithms to generate music.

As a trivial example, imagine that you put a cat on a piano to randomly press keys to generate music. The music is thus the result of a predetermined algorithm rather than of your instantaneous emotions or compositional skills. This is why it is called *automatic* composition.

Automatic composition has many different approaches or paradigms. You may want to read the book [Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithmic-Composition-Paradigms-Automated-Generation/dp/3211999159/) for a big picture.

The approach I take is inspired by the theories of Arnold Schoenberg, Heinrich Schenker and William Caplin. The key idea is that **music can develop or be generated from limited materials under some common operations**. I will explain this idea in the following three sections.


## Generate Music from Limited Materials

Let's see an example, the beginning of Beethoven's first piano sonata:

![](assets/beethoven_sonata.png)

<audio controls>
  <source src="assets/beethoven_sonata.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

As indicated below, the two framed structures are almost identical:

![](assets/beethoven_sonata_repeat_1.png)

In fact, the structure in the blue frame can be generated by merely transposing the structure in the red one. Therefore, to compose this piece, I need only to create the structure in the red frame, then reuse or slightly modify it to generate the structure in the blue frame, rather than create both structures from scratch.

The same situation happens in other parts too. As indicated below, the four framed structures are also highly similar:

![](assets/beethoven_sonata_repeat_2.png)

Does this kind of reuse exist only in Beethoven's music? No, this probably happens in every musical work. **No matter how long a musical work lasts or how varied it can sound, the amount of its core materials is always small.**

For another example, the following is an excerpt from Mozart's K. 485:

![](assets/mozart_rondo.png)

Sometimes, however, a material can be modified so much that you can barely recognize it, as in the following example, the beginning of Chopinâ€™s nocturne Op.9 No.1:

![](assets/chopin_op9_no1_repeat.png)

<audio controls>
  <source src="assets/chopin_op9_no1.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

The two framed structures look and sound quite different, but, in my approach, it is still that the structure in the blue frame can be generated by elaborating the structure in the red one, rather than that it has to be conceived independently. It is so because the two structures have some morphological characteristics in common, they have the same background harmonic progression, and from the perspective of musical form, the structure in the blue frame is indeed a repetition of the structure in the red one.[^1]

Please note that, in stating that a structure can be generated from other structure, I do not assert that Beethoven or Chopin actually did this or deliberately did this when composing music. Rather, my point is that we can use this music generation perspective to formalize or automate the process of musical composition.
