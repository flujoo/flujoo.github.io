Here is my first music album "Night". It is a dark ambient album written for solo piano, which describes images and emotions related to night. This album has not been completed yet, so I present here only the first four works. The audio files are generated by Logic Pro.


## Prelude "Midnight"

It is midnight. The grandfather clock in the living room is ringing. You are transitioning from wakefulness to sleep. 


## Prelude "Moonlight"

The moon over the sea is blurred in the clouds. As the waves get stronger and stronger, the moon looms out.


## Prelude & Fugue "Street after Rain"

It is two o'clock a.m. You have just got out of a bar and are now walking on a street. It just rained, so the pavement is wet, reflecting the lights. You are a little drunk. You feel chill, comfortable, and wistful.


## Sonata "A Rainy Night"

It is late in the night. A cold wind is blowing outside. You feel it is about to rain. An unsettled feeling reminds you of a similar night many years ago. Faces in your memories are so unclear. What is left is only a feeling of suspense. You remember you felt cold, confused and frustrated. Where are they now? You ask youself. A heavy rain suddenly comes down and soon stops. Then there is only an ominous silence.
