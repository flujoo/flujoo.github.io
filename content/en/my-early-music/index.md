Here are some of my early compositions. Most of them are for practice purposes excerpt for the first one "Wind Is Ring". The audio files are generated by MuseScore or Finale, so they may sound a little mechanical, although I tried to make them sound as natural as possible by carefully setting dynamics, pedals and tempos. Hope you can ignore the sound effect and enjoy the music.


## "Wind Is Rising"

[Score](scores/wind_is_rising.pdf)

On a crisp autumn day, when the wind is rising, you suddenly remember a good time in the past. You enjoy the vivid past memories, but as always, you soon realize that old times and people can never come back. Then a sad nostalgic feeling wells up.
