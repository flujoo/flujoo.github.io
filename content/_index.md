I compose music, write code, design science-based courses for kids, and am good at self-learning.

[My blog](/en) ([中文](/cn)) is about these topics. Get [RSS](/index.xml).

Some of my projects:

- [R package "gm"](https://github.com/flujoo/gm) for generation of music scores and audio files
- [music album "Night"](/en/my-music-album-night)
